# Bayesian regression (using the R package 'rstanarm') uses Markov-chain Monte Carlo
# simulation to supply the parameter estimates. Essentially, to find our regression
# coefficients, we need to find the posterior distribution that they lie on, a probability
# distribution that is proportional to the maximum likelihood estimation of our coefficients
# and our prior beliefs of the probability distribution that our parameter of interest follows.
# The algorithm is complex, but essentially we can construct a random sample from our
# posterior distribution, where each estimate sampled is influenced by the one that came
# before it (called a Markov Chain), Using Markov chain sampling, we can draw samples from
# the posterior distribution without knowing the complete properties of said distribution. Under
# standard Monte Carlo simulation, samples (which follow a distribution) are made independent,
# yet using a Markov chain, in this case, allows us to hone in on the posterior distribution
# where we believe our true coefficient of effect lies.


# 4,000 samples are taken into account, and the median values of these probabilities
# are our best estimate for beta (which is assumed to follow a probability
# distribution in Bayesian statistics, rather than simply being a fixed, point-estimate as in
# the Frequentist case). To reiterate, our estimates derive from generating random values
# from the posterior PDF, where our best estimate beta is stationed,
# so it stands that every time we run a bayesian regression our best estimate will change
# very slightly since our random samples will fluctuate. The change isn't significant; however, we should set a seed in order to obtain consistent reporting results.

# Given that our dependent variable follows a Bernoulli distribution (our random variable
# can take only 2 possible outcomes as either you test negative or positive for COVID-19),
# we can estimate using a logistic regression. This allows us to find the probability that our
# dependent variable is true, given what we observe from our independent variables.

# More specifically, the coefficients we receive will tell us the log-odds that we test
# positive, given a 1 unit increase in our continuous independent variable, age.
# To give a better interpretation, we can standardize our age variable and take the inverse
# logit of the coefficient to convert our log-odds value into a probability. As it is now, our
# intercept value tells us that our model predicts that the log-odds of contracting COVID
# when someone is of age 0 is 0.2381. Additionally, for every one year increase in age, the log
# odds of contracting COVID increase by 0.0024. As we can see, this doesn't make for a very
# useful interpretation.

posterior_interval(logistic_age_standardized)

# on testing positive is between -0.5115072 & 0.6569168.

# To illustrate this with the posterior distribution of our parameter estimates: we can see

# Onto an additional method: 

# Although this analysis has rested on Bayesian methods, I feel that it's useful, given the
# relatively small sample size of subjects in this clinical experiment, to conduct frequentist
# bootstrap analysis.



# Using this method, we can sample from our sample (with replacement) using our original
# sample data. Given that we assume our sample is our best estimate of what our population
# distribution looks like, sampling from it is akin to running a continuous amount of
# homogenous clinical trials, all outcomes in some way representing what our population
# results would be.


# It is important to note that this bootstrap method outlined is based on the Frequentist
# school of thought. I've decided to briefly switch over from Bayesian methods, as I don't
# have any real experience with bayesian bootstrapping, and I feel as if I wouldn't be
# accurately able to explain what is going on behind the code. My understanding is our
# current described method wouldn't make intuitive sense to a Bayesian, as the data is
# presumed fixed, and repeatedly sampling from it would acknowledge that it comes from a
# larger population distribution and is not âfixed.â In this sense, a bayesian bootstrap
# would strive to sample from a series of posterior distributions containing regression
# coefficients, instead of the observed data sample.

# 95% Frequentist Confidence Interval from bootstrap sampling:
# We are 95% certain that the true, log-odds effect of hydroxychloroquine concentration on
# testing positive for COVID lies between (-8.312200, -1.522801).

# Rather than being based on the observed sample data, which is assumed to be "fixed" from
# our above observations, this result is based on hypothesized repeated experiments.
# This is an important distinction, as we assume that our data is 'random' in that our
# observations are sampled from a larger, unknown population distribution. We then try to
# estimate a point estimate from modeling our regression estimators after our sample data, in
# contrast to the bayesian assumption that our parameter estimates follow a distribution and
# we can assume a prior distribution before attempting to maximize the likelihood of observing
# the data given our model parameters. This is the reason why we are allowed to estimate a
# posterior distribution (a compromise between our prior distribution assumptions and the
# evidence of what our effect looks like after having seen our fixed data sample) of the
# coefficients above.



# In this frequentist interpretation, we can say that if we were to repeat this experiment
# an infinite amount of times and draw confidence intervals each of the time for dose effect,
# 95% of those intervals will contain the true, parameter effect of dose concentration value
# on testing positive for COVID.


# * Remember, these effects resemble log-odds, as we can't gauge whether 0 is a plausible
# value if we convert the log-odds values into probabilities. This is because the interval
# can never encompass 0 with both negative and positive values, as non-negativity is a
# self-evident truth of probability, written into Kolmogorov's first axiom that P(A) >= 0.

# While we are using a Frequentist method, let's analyze statistical significance through the
# p-value:
z = (0 - mean(coef)) / sd(coef)
p = pnorm(z, lower.tail = T)
qnorm(p)
sum(coef >= 0) / sims

# This is our p-value, which tells us the probability that we have observed what we have
# observed, given that our null hypothesis is true. More specifically, it is the probability
# that we observe an equal or greater value than our test-statistic of roughly ~ 2.5,
# assuming that the beta effect is 0.


# As we can see, the probability of observing this value, under the assumption that our
# null hypothesis is true, is extremely low. We can, thus, reject the null hypothesis of a 0
# beta value, for the dose concentration, log effect of testing positive for COVID,
# at the 5% & 1% significance level.
