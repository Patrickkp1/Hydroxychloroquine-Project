# Hydroxychloroquine Experiment Recreation / Expansion

# Summary: I use Bayesian and Frequentist Analysis to determine the efficacy of Hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for COVID-19. Along with recreating the analysis presented by Gautret & his medical research team, I try to expand the statistical analysis to determine whether a Hydroxychloroquine treatment would be effective in reducing the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA concentration in patients.
